??? Info "Bot Account Setup"

    If you don't already have a bot account, please go to [roblox.com](https://roblox.com) and create one. 

    To set up a bot account you have two options: one is using username + password (recommended) or using the account cookie (not recommended as its unreliable and requires you to use a VPN). 

    In the dashboard, click the box that says ROBLOX. You should see something similar to this.

    !!! Success "You've now setup your bot!"


??? Info "Game Whitelisting (Application and Rank Center Only!"

    In order for the Application and Rank centers' to function correctly you need to whitelist the game ID. To do this, follow the steps below.
